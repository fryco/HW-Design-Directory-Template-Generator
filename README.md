Misc tools/scripts for supporting HW/SW engineer work.

## HW Design Directory Template
Directory template generator dedicated to control hardware design flow.

**Usage:** run python script `HwDirectoryTreeGenerator.py` 

For detailed directory tree description please check `Directory_Template_Manual.pdf` (will be generated by script).

Additional features:
* Simple, local control version mechanism provided by `BackMeUp.py` script. It creates zip archive with current timestamp.

Directory tree looks like:
```
