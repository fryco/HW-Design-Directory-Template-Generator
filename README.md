## HW Design Directory Template Generator
Directory template generator dedicated to control hardware design flow.

**Usage:** 
1. Open script `HwDirectoryTreeGenerator.py`

2. Read comments.

3. Setup client/project/tool info.

4. Run script python `HwDirectoryTreeGenerator.py`.

5. Enjoy complete directory tree for your new project.

For detailed directory tree description please check `Directory_Template_Manual.pdf` (will be generated by script).

Additional features:
* Simple, local control version mechanism provided by `BackMeUp.py` script. It creates zip archive with current timestamp.
* Easy development and maintanance 

Directory tree looks like:
